    This function calculates the approximate polychromatic focal spot of a set of rays.
    To do so, it positions itself in the detector plane and samples a square area.
    If the size of the area is not given, it will use twice the Airy radius of the system with the largest wavbelength.
    Otherwise it uses the size.
    The resolution of the sampling is given by the resolution parameter. So it samples on a grid resolution x resolution.

    To calculate the intensity, it takes Nrays out of the raylist (to subsample if needed).
    It assimilates every ray to a plane wave, so it calculates a k-vector for each ray (taking into account the wavelength of the ray).
    It calculates the phase of each ray from the delay and from the intersection position with the detector.
    The delay from the non-central position is simply sin(alpha)*distance/c, where alpha is the angle between the ray and the normal to the detector
    and distance is the distance between the intersection point and the central point of the detector. 
    It then calculates the intensity at each point of the grid by summing the intensity of each plane wave.

    As long as there are not too many rays, this method is faster than doing an FFT.
    It's also naturally polychromatic.
