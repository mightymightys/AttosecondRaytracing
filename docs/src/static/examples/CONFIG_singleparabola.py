#Support =  msupp.SupportRound(50)

"""
Now that the optical chain has been automatically created with perfect alignment, you can mess with it:
As a demonstration, mis-align the parabola slightly out of the incidence plane, i.e. rotate its normal about its major axis,
which is what the rotate_roll_by(angle in degress)-method of the optical elements does:
"""
ParabolaOE = OpticalChainList.optical_elements[0] #pick out the parabola (it's the only element in the list anyway)
turnby = np.rad2deg(50e-6) #in deg
ParabolaOE.rotate_roll_by(turnby)  

# This is enough, we have modified directly a property of the OpticalChain-object.
