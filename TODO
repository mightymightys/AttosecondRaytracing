What needs to be done:

- Source should become its own class
- OpticalChain should incorporate Source and possible Detectors
- Polychromatic diffraction limit using coherent plane waves
- Change run_ART and add it to setup.py so that we can run ART directly as a command
 Rotate rays into ref frame of detector, put coordinates into numpy array and quickly solve for x and y positions.
- Make proper constructor for the Detector class and same for Source class
 Add to each optical element some more characteristic vectors in addition to "support_normal"
- Add callbacks to ray-tracing and to other functions such as detector optimisation
- Implement polychromatic wavefront extraction
- Implement polychromatic sources
- Add unit test suite
- Add simplistic Grating of spherical type? Implement proper reference vectors for it
- Add support visualisation
- Add important axes visualisation for OEs
- Add tolerancing to ART package
- Add report printing to ART package
